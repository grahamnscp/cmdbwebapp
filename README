CMDB Web App

This is a simple CGI script application written in Ruby to maintain SOE CMDB entries in an LDAP backend.

The app consists of the following main programs:

list   - The Home page, lists all the managedServer entries in the DIT

show   - Displays the selected system entry, it's first disk and two network NICs 
         (kind of hard coded config)
         Importantly, the show script also handles the form posts from the create and 
         edit forms, validates the data and when all okay persists it to the CMDB and
         then reads it back for display.

create - HTML form to create a new system, displays dropdowns and picklists etc from
         various LOV files.
         Some entries are defaulted in the create html itself, made creating a new
         entry quicker when some typical values were the same.

edit   - HTML form to edit an existing entry, acts largely the same as the create 
         form but entries are read from the CMDB first and their values selected in
         the various dropdown lists etc.  Note that an edited entry is deleted and 
         saved so it is possible to get a lost update scenario with multiple users.

delete - Deletes the entry without confirmation check!


and has common helper elements:

globals.rb - Old C programmers like globals and types files etc
helper.rb  - Broke out common functions and put them in this helper, LDAP backend 
             hidden here to.


Note that the page header and footer are in the html files so they are common.
